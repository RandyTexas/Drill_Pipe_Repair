            <p>Redneck Pipe Rental is focused on high-quality products and providing an equally high level of service and support. We make the promise to our customers to track all pipes that come in and out of our shops, making sure they always exceed standards for safety and performance. Our experts are committed to delivering unmatched quality assurance with detailed inspections of each joint.</p>
            <br>
            <p>We strive to provide a level of long-lasting performance competitors can’t match, so customers can know they’re getting the most out of every pipe. By improving on old industry standards, we make it happen. In fact, our new drill pipe tube features a minimum wall thickness of .355”, compared to the standard .333”. When pipes are repaired, a ground-breaking 5/8” cut is used to do the job—over half the size of standard cuts. And that’s just the start…</p>

                <h2>PTECH Completion Drill Pipe™</h2>
                <p>Conventional, industry-standard tubing presents various challenges when dealing with extended reach and other critical completion operations. To meet the demands of these drilling operations, PTECH Completion Drill Pipe provides higher torsional strength, gas-tight seals, and a streamlined connection profile.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Field-proven PTECH Completion Drill Pipe™ combines metal-to-metal seal connections—highlighted by a rotary shoulder connection—with the pressure integrity of a premium connection. The streamlined configuration of this tubing also features an oversized inside diameter throughout the connection and tube, effectively maximizing hydraulic efficiency and preventing obstruction.</p>
                <br>
                <p>PTECH Completion Drill Pipe is available in 2-3/8” and 2-7/8” diameter sizes.</p>

        <h2>PTECH High-Torque Drill Pipe™</h2>
        <br>
        <p>PTECH High-Torque Drill Pipe™ is the trusted industry solution for long laterals and other demanding drilling applications, featuring a patented design with a robust rotary shoulder connection. This connection delivers significantly higher torsional capacity than standard connections (of similar size), while also meeting the strictest standards of safety and dependability for drilling operations in rougher, high-risk conditions. With its increased torsional capacity, the PTECH High-Torque Drill Pipe drastically improves the life of the tool joint by tolerating more OD wear. Providing superior, long-lasting performance over API and other premium drill pipes.</p>
        <br>
        PTECH High-Torque Drill Pipe is available in 4”, 4.5”, 5” and 5.5” diameter sizes.
