        <h2>Pipe Rental & Repair</h2>
        <p>Redneck Pipe Rental is the primary source for the manufacturing, rental and repair of oil and gas tubulars. We provide competitive market pricing and flat-rate monthly invoices that help keep managing operations simple. By repairing pipe in our own proprietary machine shops, we maintain control over the entire process to guarantee our tool joints last longer—extending the life of the drill pipe. We specialize in API drill pipe repair, high-performance drill pipe, drill collars, sub repair, and casing repair involving premium casing connections. Turnaround times are also fast, typically requiring only 2-3 days to complete repairs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The moment the drill pipe is on the rig, it’s not interchanged. That means our customers have peace of mind knowing they never receive lower quality pipe due to poor management or oversight. You always receive unmatched service and support throughout the life of any of our products. Adding to the reliability of our rental pipe is the fact Redneck is the only company to use only 135,000 psi tubulars for pipe accessories.</p>
